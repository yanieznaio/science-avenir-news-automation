# science-avenir-news-automation
Script to get the news of the day from the French website sciencesetavenir.fr  and push data (wich are the title of the article and the link to the article) in a csv file.
I converted it to exe with pyinstaller and Scheduled it with crontab to run everyday, I did this with the help of the video about python automation from  freeCodeCamp 
The reason I did this is because I need the csv file for a voice assistant project that will tell me the news titles and get me to the link if I am interested about one of these titles
